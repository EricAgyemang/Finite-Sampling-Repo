# FINITE SAMPLING (MAT 450, ISU)
# DESCRIPTION: 
Application and theory of *sampling, mathematical sampling; simple, stratified, and cluster*. Evaluation of plans with respect to precision
and cost. Additional topics and applications will be covered in the 4-hour version.

# SAMPLE
Ideally, a perfect sample would be a *scaled-down* version of the population, mirroring
every characteristic of the whole population. A good sample will be representative in
the sense that characteristics of interest in the population can be estimated from the
sample with a known degree of accuracy.

•*Observation unit:* An object on which a measurement is taken. This is the basic
unit of observation, sometimes called an element. In studying human populations,
observation units are often individuals.

•*Target population:* The complete collection of observations we want to study.
Defining the target population is an important and often difficult part of the study.

•*Sampled population:* The collection of all possible observation units that might
have been chosen in a sample; the population from which the sample was taken.

•*Sampling unit:* A unit that can be selected for a sample. We may want to study
individuals, but do not have a list of all individuals in the target population. Instead,
households serve as the sampling units, and the observation units are the
individuals living in the households.

•*Sampling frame:* A list, map, or other specification of sampling units in the
population from which a sample may be selected. For a telephone survey, the
sampling frame might be a list of all residential telephone numbers in the city. For
a survey using in-person interviews, the sampling frame might be a list of all street
addresses.

•*Selection bias:* This occurs when some part of the target population is not in the sampled
population, or, more generally, when some population units are sampled at a different
rate than intended by the investigator.
For example, if a survey designed to study household income omits transient persons,
the estimates from the survey of the average or median household income are likely to
be too large.

•*A sample of convenience"* It is often biased, since the units that are easiest to select or
that are most likely to respond are usually not representative of the harder-to-select or
nonresponding units.


# GENERAL FRAMEWORK
• Suppose *N* is the population size. That is, there are *N* units in the universe or finite
population of interest.

• The N units in the universe are denoted by an index set of labels:
        
       U = { 1, 2, 3, ... l\T }
       Note: Some texts will denote U = {u1 , u2 , u3 , . . . uN}.

• From this universe (or population) a sample of n units is to be taken. Let S represent a
sample of n units from U.

• Associated with each of the JV units is a measurable value related to the population
characteristic of interest. Let Yi be the value associated with unit i, and the population of
y-values is {Yi, Y2, ... , YN}.

• Sampling designs that m·e based on planned randomness m·e called probability samples,
and a probability P(S) is assigned to every possible smnple S.

The probability that unit *i* will be included in a sample is denoted πi and is called the
inclusion probability for unit i.SRS
